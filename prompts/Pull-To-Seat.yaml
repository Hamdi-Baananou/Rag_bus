prompt: "Extract Pull-To-Seat requirement using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: ACTION IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan for:
      ✓ Explicit \"pull-to-seat\" mentions
      ✓ Terminal insertion process descriptions:
        * \"Pull-back assembly required\"
        * \"Tug-lock mechanism\"
        * \"Retract-to-secure\"
      ✓ Alternative methods:
        * \"Pre-inserted terminals\"
        * \"Tool-free insertion\"
        * \"Push-fit design\"

    STEP 2: OPERATIONAL CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - Confirm mentions relate to PRIMARY ASSEMBLY:
      ✓ Terminal/wire installation
      ✓ Final seating action
      ✗ Maintenance/removal procedures
      ✗ Secondary locking mechanisms

    STEP 3: NEGATION HANDLING
    - Check for explicit denials:
      ✓ \"No pull-to-seat required\"
      ✓ \"Self-retaining terminals\"
      ✓ \"Zero-stroke insertion\"
    - Verify no contradictory claims

    STEP 4: ASSEMBLY CONTEXT CONFIRMATION
    - Required pull action must be:
      ✓ Final assembly step
      ✓ Necessary for terminal retention
      ✓ Performed by installer (not tool)
    - If tool-assisted pull: Treat as \"No\"

    STEP 5: FINAL VERIFICATION
    - Meets ALL criteria:
      1. Explicit pull action requirement ✓
      2. Assembly-phase context ✓
      3. No alternative retention methods ✓
    - Any ambiguity → Default to \"No\"

    **Examples:**
    - **\"Terminals require pull-back action for seating\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Pull-back → [Step2] Assembly → [Step4] Manual action 
      → PULL-TO-SEAT: **Yes**

    - **\"Pre-inserted contacts with CPA secondary lock\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Pre-inserted → [Step3] Alternative method 
      → PULL-TO-SEAT: **No**

    - **\"Secure insertion method\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Vague → [Step5] Ambiguous 
      → PULL-TO-SEAT: **No**

    **Output format:**  
    REASONING: [Key step determinations]  
    PULL-TO-SEAT: [Yes/No]
