prompt: "Determine connector color using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: PART TYPE CLASSIFICATION
    - Identify from:
      ✓ \"Assembled\"/\"Multi-component\" → Assembly
      ✓ \"Housing\"/\"Single-piece\" → Connector body
      ✓ Component lists with separate colors

    STEP 2: COLOR SOURCE SELECTION
    - For ASSEMBLIES:
      > Analyze all components (housing, latches, seals)
      > Ignore non-structural elements (labels, markings)
    - For SINGLE-PIECE:
      > Focus on housing material description
      > Ignore contact/terminal colors

    STEP 3: DOMINANCE ANALYSIS
    - Evaluate color references:
      ✓ Quantitative: \"70% black cover\"
      ✓ Qualitative: \"primary color\", \"main housing\"
      ✓ Visual hierarchy: \"red base with blue accents\"
    - Multi-color triggers:
      * \"Striped\"/\"checkered\" patterns
      * Equal distribution (\"50-50 split\")
      * Explicit \"multi-color\" statement

    STEP 4: CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - Reject ambiguous terms:
      ✗ \"Natural\" (unless defined)
      ✗ Material-inferred colors (brass=golden)
    - Accept only explicitly stated colors:
      ✓ \"Black housing\"
      ✓ \"Blue CPA latch\"

    STEP 5: FINAL RESOLUTION
    - Apply priority:
      1. Explicit dominant color
      2. Assembly majority
      3. Multi-color indicators
      4. NOT FOUND

    **Examples:**
    - **\"Black nylon housing with nickel-plated contacts\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Single-piece → [Step2] Housing color → [Step4] Explicit 
      → COLOUR: **Black**

    - **\"Assembly: White cover (60%), grey base (40%)\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Assembly → [Step3] White dominant → [Step5] Majority 
      → COLOUR: **White**

    - **\"Red/blue dual-tone design\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Single-piece → [Step3] Equal prominence → [Step5] Multi 
      → COLOUR: **multi**

    **Output format:**  
    REASONING: [Key determinations]  
    COLOUR: [color/multi/NOT FOUND]
