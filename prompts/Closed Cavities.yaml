prompt: "Determine closed cavities using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: CLOSED CAVITY IDENTIFICATION  
    - Scan for:  
      ✓ Explicit terms: \"closed cavities\", \"blocked positions\"  
      ✓ Numbered lists: \"Closed: 1,3,5\"  
      ✓ Diagram annotations: Crossed-out cavity numbers  

    STEP 2: NUMERATION VALIDATION  
    - Extract **only numbered closed cavities**:  
      ✓ Validate numerical sequencing (e.g., 1-5 vs. random)  
      ✗ Reject non-numeric descriptors (\"A,B,C closed\")  

    STEP 3: OPEN CAVITY CHECK  
    - Return `none` if:  
      ✓ \"All cavities open\" stated  
      ✓ Closed cavities lack numbers (e.g., \"two closed cavities\")  
      ✓ Mixed open/closed with no numbered closures  

    STEP 4: AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION  
    - Return `NOT FOUND` for:  
      ✗ Vague terms (\"some closed cavities\")  
      ✗ Contradictory statements  
      ✗ Missing cavity status  

    Examples:  
    \"Closed cavities: 2,4,6 (see diagram)\"  
    → REASONING: [Step1-2] Explicit numbers → **2,4,6**  
    → NAME OF CLOSED CAVITIES: 2,4,6  

    \"All cavities open for wire access\"  
    → REASONING: [Step3] All open → **none**  
    → NAME OF CLOSED CAVITIES: none  

    \"Positions 3 and 5 are blocked\"  
    → REASONING: [Step1-2] Blocked = closed but unnumbered → **none**  
    → NAME OF CLOSED CAVITIES: none  

    \"Closed cavities unspecified\"  
    → REASONING: [Step4] Ambiguous → **NOT FOUND**  
    → NAME OF CLOSED CAVITIES: NOT FOUND  

    Output format:  
    REASONING: [Step analysis summary]
    NAME OF CLOSED CAVITIES: [numbers/none/NOT FOUND]
