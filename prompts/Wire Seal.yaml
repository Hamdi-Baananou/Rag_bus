prompt: "Determine the Wire Seal type using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: TERM IDENTIFICATION  
    - Scan for explicit keywords:  
      ✓ **Single Wire Seal**:  
        * \"Per-wire seal\"  
        * Unique part numbers tied to wire sizes (e.g., \"SW-5A for 2.8mm wires\")  
      ✓ **Injected**:  
        * \"Injected sealant\"  
        * \"Potting compound\" (if cavity-specific)  
      ✓ **Mat Seal**:  
        * \"Gel seal\"/\"Silicone mat\"  
        * \"Family seal system\"  
      ✓ **None**:  
        * \"Unsealed cavities\"  
        * \"No wire sealing required\"  

    STEP 2: CONTEXT VALIDATION  
    - Confirm terms relate to **wire-to-cavity sealing**:  
      ✓ Reject general seals (e.g., housing radial seals)  
      ✓ Validate part numbers:  
        * \"SW-\" prefix → Single Wire Seal  
        * \"GEL-\" prefix → Mat Seal  

    STEP 3: CLASSIFICATION HIERARCHY  
    1. **Single Wire Seal** if part numbers map to wire sizes/positions  
    2. **Injected** for cavity-specific injected materials  
    3. **Mat Seal** for gel/silicone family terms  
    4. **None** if explicitly stated or implied by absence  

    STEP 4: CONFLICT RESOLUTION  
    - Multiple seal types? → Prioritize:  
      1. Explicit statements (\"Primary seal: Injected\")  
      2. Part number evidence  
      3. Document specificity (e.g., \"Mat Seal\" vs generic \"sealed\")  

    STEP 5: DEFAULT HANDLING  
    - No terms/part numbers after Steps 1-4? → **NOT FOUND**  

    Examples:  
    \"Cavity seals: SW-12 (1.5mm²) / SW-14 (2.5mm²)\"  
    → REASONING: [Step1] Part numbers + wire sizes → **Single Wire Seal**  
    → WIRE SEAL: Single Wire Seal  

    \"Injected epoxy seals for all cavities\"  
    → REASONING: [Step1] \"Injected\" + cavity context → **Injected**  
    → WIRE SEAL: Injected  

    \"Gel-based family sealing system\"  
    → REASONING: [Step1] \"Gel\" + \"family\" → **Mat Seal**  
    → WIRE SEAL: Mat Seal  

    \"Terminal cavities require no additional sealing\"  
    → REASONING: [Step1] Explicit negation → **None**  
    → WIRE SEAL: None  

    Output format:  
    REASONING: [Step analysis summary]
    WIRE SEAL: [Single Wire Seal/Injected/Mat Seal/None/NOT FOUND]
