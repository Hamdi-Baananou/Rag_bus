prompt: "Determine connector gender using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: TERMINAL TYPE IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan for:
      ✓ Explicit gender terms: "male"/"female"/"unisex"/"hybrid"
      ✓ Physical descriptions:
        * "Pin contacts" → Male
        * "Socket contacts" → Female
        * "Tab-and-slot" → Hybrid
      ✓ Cavity specifications:
        * "Dual-position" → Potential Hybrid
        * "Shared receptacle" → Potential Unisex

    STEP 2: CAVITY ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS
    - For mixed-gender mentions:
      ✓ Check cavity configuration:
        * "Same cavity accepts both" → Unisex
        * "Separate cavities for each" → Hybrid
      ✓ Verify contact positioning:
        * "Mating interfaces in single housing" → Unisex
        * "Dedicated header/receptacle sides" → Hybrid

    STEP 3: MANUFACTURER NOMENCLATURE
    - Interpret supplier terminology:
      * "Plug" → Typically Male
      * "Receptacle" → Typically Female
      * "Combo" → Likely Hybrid
    - Cross-validate with part numbers:
      * "-M" suffix → Male
      * "-F" suffix → Female

    STEP 4: CONFLICT RESOLUTION
    - Priority hierarchy:
      1. Explicit gender declarations
      2. Cavity configuration evidence
      3. Contact type descriptions
      4. Part number conventions
    - Reject unverified assumptions

    STEP 5: FINAL VALIDATION
    - Confirm SINGLE classification:
      ✓ Pure Male/Female: All cavities same type
      ✓ Hybrid: Separate gender-specific cavities
      ✓ Unisex: Mixed in same cavity
    - Ambiguous? → NOT FOUND

    **Examples:**
    - **\"Socket contacts in all positions\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1 ✓] Socket → [Step3 ✓] Female → [Step5 ✓] Uniform 
      → GENDER: **Female**

    - **\"Dual cavity design: pins (A1-A10) + sockets (B1-B10)\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1 ✓] Both types → [Step2 ✓] Separate cavities → [Step5 ✓] Hybrid 
      → GENDER: **Hybrid**

    - **\"Bi-directional contacts in shared housing\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1 ✓] Mixed → [Step2 ✓] Same cavity → [Step5 ✓] Unisex 
      → GENDER: **Unisex**

    **Output format:**  
    REASONING: [Step analysis with ✓/✗ markers]  
    GENDER: [Male/Female/Unisex/Hybrid/NOT FOUND]
