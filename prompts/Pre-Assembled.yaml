prompt: "Extract pre-assembly status using this reasoning chain:
STEP 1: ASSEMBLY IDENTIFICATION
- Scan for key terms:
  ✓ \"Delivered as an assembly\"
  ✓ \"Requires disassembly in production\"
  ✓ \"Pre-assembled\" (context-dependent)
  ✓ Components: TPA, CPA, lever, etc.

STEP 2: DISASSEMBLY CONTEXT VALIDATION
- For \"Yes\":
  ✓ Explicit disassembly requirement for production use
  ✓ Full connector assembly needing breakdown
- For \"No\":
  ✓ Preassembled components (TPA/CPA/lever) with no disassembly needed
  ✓ Statements like \"ready-to-use assembly\"

STEP 3: COMPONENT VS FULL ASSEMBLY
- Differentiate:
  ✓ Full connector assembly → Check for disassembly mandates
  ✓ Individual components → Check if they're add-ons requiring removal

STEP 4: EXPLICIT STATEMENT PRIORITIZATION
- Hierarchy of evidence:
  1. Direct disassembly instructions (\"Must disassemble before installation\")
  2. Delivery format (\"Shipped fully assembled\")
  3. Component mentions without disassembly context

STEP 5: FINAL CLASSIFICATION
- Return \"Yes\" ONLY if:
  1. Full assembly delivered AND
  2. Explicit disassembly required for production
- Return \"No\" if:
  1. Components preassembled BUT
  2. No full disassembly needed
- Default to NOT FOUND otherwise

Examples:
\"Fully assembled connector; disassemble terminals before wiring\"
→ REASONING: [Step1] Assembly + disassembly → [Step5] Yes 
→ PRE-ASSEMBLED: Yes

\"Includes preassembled CPA latch (no disassembly required)\"
→ REASONING: [Step2] Component-only → [Step5] No 
→ PRE-ASSEMBLED: No

\"Modular housing with TPA\"
→ REASONING: [Step1] No disassembly context → [Step5] Default 
→ PRE-ASSEMBLED: NOT FOUND

Output format:
REASONING: [Key determinations]  
PRE-ASSEMBLED: [Yes/No/NOT FOUND]
