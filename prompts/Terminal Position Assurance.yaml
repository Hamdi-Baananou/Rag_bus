prompt: "Extract Terminal Position Assurance (TPA) count using this reasoning chain:
STEP 1: TPA IDENTIFICATION
- Scan documents for:
  ✓ Explicit terms: \"TPA\", \"Terminal Position Assurance\", \"Anti-Backout\"
  ✓ Part numbers with TPA identifiers (e.g., \"-TPA1\", \"-2T\")
  ✓ Assembly diagrams showing TPA components

STEP 2: PREASSEMBLY STATUS CHECK
- Verify if TPA is **delivered preinstalled**:
  ✓ \"Preassembled TPA\"
  ✓ \"Included with housing\"
  ✗ \"Assemble TPA during production\" → Return 0

STEP 3: COUNT RESOLUTION
- For preassembled TPAs:
  1. Direct count: \"Dual TPAs\" → 2
  2. Position-based inference:
     * \"1 TPA per 12 cavities\" → Total = Cavities ÷ 12
     * Single-position connector → Default 1
- For multiple TPAs:
  ✓ Sum explicitly stated numbers
  ✓ Reject ambiguous terms (\"Multiple TPAs\" → NOT FOUND)

STEP 4: VALIDATION
- Confirm TPA count aligns with:
  ✓ Physical connector size/cavities
  ✓ Manufacturer specifications
- Implausible counts (e.g., 5 TPAs on 2-cavity connector) → NOT FOUND

STEP 5: DEFAULT HANDLING
- No TPA mentions after Step 1? → NOT FOUND
- Assembly required? → 0

Examples:
\"Preassembled dual TPA (P/N TPA2-456)\"
→ REASONING: [Step1] TPA term + P/N → [Step2] Preassembled → [Step3] Explicit count 
→ TERMINAL POSITION ASSURANCE: 2

\"Install TPA-7A during wire harnessing\"
→ REASONING: [Step2] Requires assembly → Return 0 
→ TERMINAL POSITION ASSURANCE: 0

\"6-cavity housing with 1 TPA per 3 cavities\"
→ REASONING: [Step3] 6 ÷ 3 = 2 → Valid 
→ TERMINAL POSITION ASSURANCE: 2

Output format:
REASONING: [Key determinations]
TERMINAL POSITION ASSURANCE: [number/0/NOT FOUND]
