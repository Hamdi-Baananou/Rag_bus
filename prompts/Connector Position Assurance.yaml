prompt: "Determine Connector Position Assurance (CPA) status using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: TERM SCAN  
    - Search for explicit terms:  
      ✓ **CPA**, **Connector Position Assurance**, **Anti-Backout**  
      ✓ Part numbers with CPA identifiers (e.g., \"-CPA\", \"-AB\")  
      ✓ Diagram labels: \"CPA Lock\", \"Position Assurance Clip\"  

    STEP 2: CONTEXT VALIDATION  
    - Confirm terms relate to **connector retention**:  
      ✓ \"Prevents unintentional disconnection\"  
      ✓ \"Secondary locking mechanism\"  
      ✗ Reject unrelated uses (e.g., \"Anti-Backout algorithm\")  

    STEP 3: FUNCTIONAL INFERENCE  
    - Analyze described/pictured components:  
      ✓ Latches, clips, or levers labeled as CPA  
      ✓ \"Secure mating\" features requiring deliberate action to disconnect  

    STEP 4: CONFLICT RESOLUTION  
    - For conflicting mentions (e.g., \"CPA\" vs. \"No secondary lock\"):  
      1. Prioritize **latest document version**  
      2. Prefer engineering drawings > marketing materials  
      3. Use explicit denials (\"No CPA\") over ambiguous terms  

    STEP 5: DEFAULT HANDLING  
    - No CPA mentions after Steps 1-3? → **NOT FOUND**  

    Examples:  
    \"Includes CPA latch (P/N CPA-456)\"  
    → REASONING: [Step1] Term + P/N → **Yes**  
    → CONNECTOR POSITION ASSURANCE: Yes  

    \"No secondary locking features\"  
    → REASONING: [Step4] Explicit denial → **No**  
    → CONNECTOR POSITION ASSURANCE: No  

    \"Secure mating interface\"  
    → REASONING: [Step1-3] No CPA terms → **NOT FOUND**  
    → CONNECTOR POSITION ASSURANCE: NOT FOUND  

    Output format:  
    REASONING: [Step analysis summary]
    CONNECTOR POSITION ASSURANCE: [Yes/No/NOT FOUND]
