prompt: "Extract material filling additives using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: ADDITIVE IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan document sections for:
      ✓ Explicit additive declarations (GF, GB, MF, T)
      ✓ Mechanical property context clues:
        * \"reinforced with...\"
        * \"improved [strength/stiffness] using...\"
        * \"contains X% [additive]\"
      ✓ Negative statements: \"no additives\", \"unfilled\"
    STEP 2: CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - For each candidate additive:
      ✓ Confirm direct mechanical purpose:
        - \"GF30 for stiffness\" → Valid ✓ 
        - \"GB colorant\" → Rejected ✗ (non-mechanical)
      ✗ Reject incidental mentions:
        - \"MF manufacturing facility\" → Rejected ✗ 
    STEP 3: NEGATION CHECK
    - If explicit \"no additives\" statement is found:
      ✓ Verify no contradictory mentions.
      ✓ If confirmed, return **\"none\"**.
    STEP 4: STANDARDIZATION
    - Convert equivalents to standard abbreviations:
      * \"Glass fiber\" → GF
      * \"Mineral-filled\" → MF
      * \"Talc-filled\" → T
      * \"Glass beads\" → GB
      * \"Mica-filled\" → MF
    - Reject non-standard or ambiguous terms:
      * \"Carbon additives\" → **NOT FOUND**
    STEP 5: CERTAINTY ASSESSMENT
    - Final check:
      ✓ At least **one** valid additive with mechanical context.
      ✓ No ambiguous or non-standard terms.
      ✓ No conflicting information.
    - If any doubts exist → **NOT FOUND**.
    **Examples:**
    - **PA66-GF30-T15 (improved impact resistance)**  
      → REASONING: [Step1] Identified GF, T with mechanical context → [Step2] Valid → [Step4] Standardized  
      → MATERIAL FILLING: **GF, T**  
    - **Unfilled PPS compound**  
      → REASONING: [Step1] \"Unfilled\" found → [Step3] Negative confirmation  
      → MATERIAL FILLING: **none**  
    - **Contains 5% specialty reinforcement**  
      → REASONING: [Step1] Non-standard term → [Step4] Rejected → [Step5] Uncertain  
      → MATERIAL FILLING: **NOT FOUND**  
    **Output format:**  
    REASONING: [Step analysis summary]  
    MATERIAL FILLING: [abbreviations/none/NOT FOUND]
