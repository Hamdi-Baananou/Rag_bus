prompt: "Identify approved contact systems using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: SOURCE IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan for:
      ✓ Explicit system families (MQS, MLK, SLK, etc.)
      ✓ Terminal part numbers (123-4567, XW3D-XXXX-XX)
      ✓ Manufacturer approval statements:
        * \"Approved for use with...\"
        * \"Compatible contact systems:\"
        * \"Recommended mating system\"

    STEP 2: MANUFACTURER PRIORITIZATION
    - Verify mentions are supplier-specified:
      ✓ Direct manufacturer recommendations
      ✗ Customer-specific part numbers
      ✗ Generic terminal references

    STEP 3: SYSTEM RESOLUTION HIERARCHY
    1. Primary: Explicit family mentions (MQS 0.64)
    2. Secondary: Part number mapping:
       - Cross-reference with manufacturer catalogs
       - Match patterns (e.g., 928321-1 → TE MCP 1.2)
    3. Reject unidentifiable part numbers

    STEP 4: MULTI-SYSTEM VALIDATION
    - Check for:
      ✓ Multiple approval statements
      ✓ Hybrid connector systems
      ✓ Generation variants (MQS Gen2 vs Gen3)
    - Require explicit documentation for each system

    STEP 5: STANDARDIZATION CHECK
    - Convert to manufacturer nomenclature:
      \"Micro Quadlock\" → MQS
      \"H-MTD\" → HMTD
    - Maintain versioning: MLK 1.2 ≠ MLK 2.0

    **Examples:**
    - **\"Approved systems: MQS 0.64 & SLK 2.8 (P/N 345-789)\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] MQS/SLK explicit → [Step2] Approved → [Step5] Standardized 
      → CONTACT SYSTEMS: **MQS 0.64,SLK 2.8**

    - **\"Terminals: 927356-1 (MCP series)\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Part number → [Step3] Mapped to MCP → [Step2] Implicit approval 
      → CONTACT SYSTEMS: **MCP**

    - **\"Compatible with various 2.8mm systems\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1] Vague → [Step5] Non-specific → [Final] NOT FOUND 
      → CONTACT SYSTEMS: **NOT FOUND**

    **Output format:**  
    REASONING: [Key determinations]  
    CONTACT SYSTEMS: [system1,system2,.../NOT FOUND]
