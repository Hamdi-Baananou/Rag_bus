prompt: "Determine housing seal type using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: EXACT TERM SCAN
    - Search for case-sensitive matches ONLY:
      ✓ \"Radial Seal\" (capital R, capital S)
      ✓ \"Interface Seal\" (capital I, capital S)
    - Immediately reject:
      ✗ Lowercase variations (\"radial seal\")
      ✗ Plural/gerund forms (\"Seals\", \"Sealing\")
      ✗ Combined terms (\"Radial/Interface\")

    STEP 2: SEAL CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - Confirm matches refer specifically to:
      ✓ Connector-to-counterpart interface
      ✓ Environmental sealing function
      ✗ Internal terminal seals
      ✗ Secondary locking features

    STEP 3: CASE-SENSITIVITY VERIFICATION
    - Character-by-character check:
      ✓ \"R\" in Radial must be uppercase
      ✓ \"I\" in Interface must be uppercase
      ✓ \"S\" in Seal must be uppercase
    - Reject even minor deviations:
      ✗ \"Interface seal\" (lowercase S)
      ✗ \"RADIAL SEAL\" (all caps)

    STEP 4: EXCLUSIVE MATCH RESOLUTION
    - If multiple matches:
      ✓ Prioritize document hierarchy:
        * \"Primary: Radial Seal\" → Select Radial
        * \"Standard: Interface Seal\" → Select Interface
      ✗ Reject ambiguous combinations:
        * \"Available with Radial Seal or Interface Seal\"

    STEP 5: FINAL VALIDATION
    - Strict requirements:
      1. Exact term match
      2. Proper case sensitivity
      3. Single validated occurrence
      4. Housing-specific context

    **Examples:**
    - **\"Housing-to-counterpart seal: Radial Seal\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1 ✓] Match → [Step2 ✓] Context → [Step3 ✓] Case → Valid 
      → HOUSING SEAL: **Radial Seal**

    - **\"interface Seal (P/N RS-456)\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1 ✓] Lowercase 'i' → [Step3 ✗] Rejected → NOT FOUND 
      → HOUSING SEAL: **NOT FOUND**

    - **\"Radial Seal (primary) + Interface Seal (secondary)\"**
      → REASONING: [Step1 ✓] Multiple → [Step4 ✓] Hierarchy → Radial 
      → HOUSING SEAL: **Radial Seal**

    **Output format:**  
    REASONING: [Step analysis with ✓/✗ markers]  
    HOUSING SEAL: [Radial Seal/Interface Seal/NOT FOUND]
