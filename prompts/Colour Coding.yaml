prompt: "Determine Colour Coding using this reasoning chain:
    STEP 1: MECHANICAL CODING PREREQUISITE
    - Confirm existence of mechanical coding:
      ✓ Check for Coding A/B/C/D/Z or physical keying
      ✗ No mechanical coding → Return \"none\"

    STEP 2: COMPONENT FOCUS IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan primary coding components:
      ✓ CPA latches ✓ TPA inserts ✓ Coding keys
      ✓ Mechanical polarization features
      ✗ Ignore non-coding parts (housing base, seals)

    STEP 3: COLOR DIFFERENTIATION CHECK
    - Compare component colors to base housing:
      ✓ Different color on ≥1 coding component → Proceed
      ✗ Identical colors → Return \"none\"
    - Validate explicit differentiation purpose:
      * \"Color-coded for variant identification\"
      * \"Visual distinction between versions\"

    STEP 4: DOMINANT COLOR SELECTION
    - Hierarchy for color determination:
      1. Explicit coding statements (\"Red denotes Type B\")
      2. Majority of coding components
      3. Highest contrast vs housing
      4. First mentioned color

    STEP 5: DOCUMENT CONSISTENCY VERIFICATION
    - Require ALL:
      1. Same drawing/family context
      2. Multiple connector variants present
      3. Color-coding purpose clearly stated
    - Reject isolated color mentions

    EXAMPLES:
    \"Type A (Blue CPA) vs Type B (Red CPA)\"
    → REASONING: [Step1] Mech coding ✓ → [Step3] Color diff ✓ → [Step4] Explicit 
    → COLOUR CODING: Blue/Red (depending on variant)

    \"Black housing with black CPA/TTA\"
    → REASONING: [Step1] Mech coding ✓ → [Step3] No diff → \"none\" 
    → COLOUR CODING: none

    Output format:
    REASONING: [Step analysis summary]  
    COLOUR CODING: [Color/none/NOT FOUND]
