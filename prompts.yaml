    Document type: {document_type}
    Focus areas: Material compositions and additives
    
    ## Document Content
    ```
    {document_content}
    ```
    
    ## Extraction Task
    Please extract the following information:
    
    Extract material filling additives using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: ADDITIVE IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan document sections for:
      ✓ Explicit additive declarations (GF, GB, MF, T)
      ✓ Mechanical property context clues:
        * "reinforced with..."
        * "improved [strength/stiffness] using..."
        * "contains X% [additive]"
      ✓ Negative statements: "no additives", "unfilled"

    STEP 2: CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - For each candidate additive:
      ✓ Confirm direct mechanical purpose:
        - "GF30 for stiffness" → Valid ✓ 
        - "GB colorant" → Rejected ✗ (non-mechanical)
      ✗ Reject incidental mentions:
        - "MF manufacturing facility" → Rejected ✗ 

    STEP 3: NEGATION CHECK
    - If explicit "no additives" statement is found:
      ✓ Verify no contradictory mentions.
      ✓ If confirmed, return **"none"**.

    STEP 4: STANDARDIZATION
    - Convert equivalents to standard abbreviations:
      * "Glass fiber" → GF
      * "Mineral-filled" → MF
      * "Talc-filled" → T
      * "Glass beads" → GB
      * "Mica-filled" → MF
    - Reject non-standard or ambiguous terms:
      * "Carbon additives" → **NOT FOUND**

    STEP 5: CERTAINTY ASSESSMENT
    - Final check:
      ✓ At least **one** valid additive with mechanical context.
      ✓ No ambiguous or non-standard terms.
      ✓ No conflicting information.
    - If any doubts exist → **NOT FOUND**.

    # Document Information Extraction
    
    You are a specialized document analysis AI tasked with extracting structured information from the following document.
    
    ## Context
    The document is from: {document_source}
    Document type: {document_type}
    Focus areas: Terminal insertion and assembly methods
    
    ## Document Content
    ```
    {document_content}
    ```
    
    ## Extraction Task
    Please extract the following information:
    
    Determine Pull-To-Seat requirement using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: ACTION IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan for:
      ✓ Explicit "pull-to-seat" mentions
      ✓ Terminal insertion process descriptions:
        * "Pull-back assembly required"
        * "Tug-lock mechanism"
        * "Retract-to-secure"
      ✓ Alternative methods:
        * "Pre-inserted terminals"
        * "Tool-free insertion"
        * "Push-fit design"

    STEP 2: OPERATIONAL CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - Confirm mentions relate to PRIMARY ASSEMBLY:
      ✓ Terminal/wire installation
      ✓ Final seating action
      ✗ Maintenance/removal procedures
      ✗ Secondary locking mechanisms

    STEP 3: NEGATION HANDLING
    - Check for explicit denials:
      ✓ "No pull-to-seat required"
      ✓ "Self-retaining terminals"
      ✓ "Zero-stroke insertion"
    - Verify no contradictory claims

    STEP 4: ASSEMBLY CONTEXT CONFIRMATION
    - Required pull action must be:
      ✓ Final assembly step
      ✓ Necessary for terminal retention
      ✓ Performed by installer (not tool)
    - If tool-assisted pull: Treat as "No"

    STEP 5: FINAL VERIFICATION
    - Meets ALL criteria:
      1. Explicit pull action requirement ✓
      2. Assembly-phase context ✓
      3. No alternative retention methods ✓
    - Any ambiguity → Default to "No"

    # Document Information Extraction
    
    You are a specialized document analysis AI tasked with extracting structured information from the following document.
    
    ## Context
    The document is from: {document_source}
    Document type: {document_type}
    Focus areas: Material compositions and polymer types
    
    ## Document Content
    ```
    {document_content}
    ```
    
    ## Extraction Task
    Please extract the following information:
    
    Extract primary polymer material using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: MATERIAL IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan for:
      ✓ Explicit polymer declarations (PA66, PBT, etc.)
      ✓ Composite notations (PA6-GF30, PPS-MF15)
      ✓ Additive markers (GF, GB, MF, T)
      ✓ Weight percentages (PA(70%), PBT(30%))

    STEP 2: BASE MATERIAL ISOLATION
    - Remove additives/fillers from composite names:
      PA66-GF30 → PA66
      LCP-MF45 → LCP
    - If additives-only mentioned (GF40): 
      → Check context for base polymer
      → Else: NOT FOUND

    STEP 3: WEIGHT HIERARCHY ANALYSIS
    - Compare numerical weights when present:
      PA66(55%)/PA6(45%) → PA66
    - No weights? Use declaration order:
      "Primary material: PPS, Secondary: LCP" → PPS

    STEP 4: SPECIFICITY RESOLUTION
    - Prefer exact grades:
      PA66 > PA6 > PA
      PPSU > PPS
    - Handle generics:
      "Thermoplastic" + GF → PA
      "High-temp polymer" → PPS

    STEP 5: VALIDATION
    - Confirm single material meets ALL:
      1. Base polymer identification
      2. Weight/declaration priority
      3. Specificity requirements
    - Uncertain? → NOT FOUND
    
    ## Output Format

    # Document Information Extraction
    
    You are a specialized document analysis AI tasked with extracting structured information from the following document.
    
    ## Context
    The document is from: {document_source}
    Document type: {document_type}
    Focus areas: Temperature specifications and operational ranges
    
    ## Document Content
    ```
    {document_content}
    ```
    
    ## Extraction Task
    Please extract the following information:
    
    Determine working temperatures using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: DATA IDENTIFICATION
    - Scan for:
      ✓ Explicit temperature ranges (e.g., "-40°C to 125°C")
      ✓ Discrete values:
        * "Max. operating temp: 150°C"
        * "Minimum: -40°C"
      ✓ Standard references:
        * UL RTI/IEC/AEC-Q200
        * Automotive/Industrial grades

    STEP 2: MAX TEMPERATURE RESOLUTION
    - Collect all max candidates:
      > Explicit numbers
      > Standard-derived values (e.g., UL RTI 130°C → 130)
    - Apply hierarchy:
      1. Explicit stated maximums
      2. Range upper bounds ("X°C to Y°C" → Y)
      3. Standard implications
    - No data? → 999

    STEP 3: MIN TEMPERATURE RESOLUTION
    - Collect min candidates:
      > Explicit numbers
      > Standard implications:
        * Automotive → -40°C
        * Industrial → -20°C
        * MIL-SPEC → -55°C
    - Apply hierarchy:
      1. Explicit stated minimums
      2. Range lower bounds
      3. Standard inferences
    - No data? → 999

    STEP 4: CONFLICT RESOLUTION
    - Validate Max > Min:
      > If explicit conflict (e.g., Max=100, Min=150):
        → Prioritize explicit values
        → Note inconsistency in reasoning
    - Handle multiple standards:
      > Use most stringent applicable

    STEP 5: FINAL VALIDATION
    - Both values = 999? → NOT FOUND
    - Any value ≠999? → Final output

    Determine connector color using this reasoning chain:

    STEP 1: PART TYPE CLASSIFICATION
    - Identify from:
      ✓ "Assembled"/"Multi-component" → Assembly
      ✓ "Housing"/"Single-piece" → Connector body
      ✓ Component lists with separate colors

    STEP 2: COLOR SOURCE SELECTION
    - For ASSEMBLIES:
      > Analyze all components (housing, latches, seals)
      > Ignore non-structural elements (labels, markings)
    - For SINGLE-PIECE:
      > Focus on housing material description
      > Ignore contact/terminal colors

    STEP 3: DOMINANCE ANALYSIS
    - Evaluate color references:
      ✓ Quantitative: "70% black cover"
      ✓ Qualitative: "primary color", "main housing"
      ✓ Visual hierarchy: "red base with blue accents"
    - Multi-color triggers:
      * "Striped"/"checkered" patterns
      * Equal distribution ("50-50 split")
      * Explicit "multi-color" statement

    STEP 4: CONTEXT VALIDATION
    - Reject ambiguous terms:
      ✗ "Natural" (unless defined)
      ✗ Material-inferred colors (brass=golden)
    - Accept only explicitly stated colors:
      ✓ "Black housing"
      ✓ "Blue CPA latch"

    STEP 5: FINAL RESOLUTION
    - Apply priority:
      1. Explicit dominant color
      2. Assembly majority
      3. Multi-color indicators
      4. NOT FOUND
